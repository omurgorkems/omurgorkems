 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @omurgorkems
- ðŸ‘€
 I am passionate about the creative side of software development, <br>
especially in areas like frontend design and UI/UX design. <br>
I love blending functuonality with aesthetic appeal to create engaging digital experiences.

- ðŸŒ± Right now, as a junior developer, <br>
  Ä± am strenghtening my frontend skills that i gained during my studies <br>
  and stepping into the exciting world of UI/UX design. 

- ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my academic journey as a chemical engineering student <br>
  but quickly (at the end of 4. year) i realized designing websites is way more fun than designing chemical proseses. <br>
  So here i am, crafting code and loving every minute of it.
